Distributors are getting more digital each day, conducting so much of their business process online, on smart devices, on the go and on their desks. Suppliers are still grappling with how to leverage this change.</p>

Busy distributors don’t always remember your url and key it in. They search on portals and search engines to find exactly what they’re looking for. If your site or pages pop up in search results, they click through to that page. It’s increasingly important for supplies websites to be highly search engine optimized. Vector Art’s technology and SEO team work in tandem. They have the experience of optimizing over 200 supplier websites. We can help your site get to the top and stay there.</p>

Tomorrow they will be active elsewhere, as they discover the value of other social channels. We help suppliers understand and leverage rapidly changing social ecosystems. We look for and find where distributors like to spend time on line. We observe their social behavior, listen to their conversations, and get armed with insights. We then help suppliers engage with distributors using meaningful, relevant content that is in synch with a planned cross channel strategy. And we help convert that engagement into measurable traffic and conversion on web.</p>

Suppliers need to have an active engagement capability – one that seeks to find and connect with distributors whenever and wherever they go mobile. We help Suppliers with what it takes to make useful mobile connections – a shift from static to real-time marketing. From fixed web content to dynamic delivery of product/promotional content that serves the Distributor’s current contexts and customer conversations.
